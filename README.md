Quiz App
This is a simple quiz app created using React functional components and hooks for state management. The app includes features such as toggling between dark and light modes, automatic navigation to the next question upon answering, and displaying the result screen after answering the final question.

The app will be accessible at http://[localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173/).

Features
Dark/Light Mode Toggle
There is a button at the top of the app that allows users to toggle between dark and light modes. The button text also dynamically changes to indicate the current mode.

QuestionBox Component
The QuestionBox component displays the current question number, question description, and four options for the user to choose from. The user can only attempt each question once, and upon answering, the app automatically moves to the next question.

Result Screen
Once the user completes all questions, a result screen is displayed, showing the user's score in percentage.

Highlight and Remove Highlight Buttons
Two additional buttons, "Highlight" and "Remove Highlight," have been added. Clicking the "Highlight" button changes the color of the question text to red, and clicking the "Remove Highlight" button reverts the color to its original state.
